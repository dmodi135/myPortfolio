# myPortfolio
This repository contains a portfolio of my important works, categorized in corresponding folders:

BMED 2250 Papers/Presentations - 
This folder contains the research papers that my team wrote as part of our design-based
BME engineering class. In these documents, the entire process that our team took from developing our problem statement to testing and modeling to prototyping can be seen. Here you can see circuit diagrams and a working ECG’s signals.

BMED 2250 Main ECG Codes - 
This folder has the main code files used in the modeling stage of our project and the final
ECG. These were done in Python as the refresh rate for Arduino wasn’t nearly high enough. The test2 file takes ECG data from a Physionet database and runs different signal processing methods including notch filters, butterworth low-passes, and digital 2nd order RC filters clean the noisy data. The goal is to find the appropriate r-peaks for proper LF/HF ratio calculations, so different peak detection algorithms were also conceived. Furthermore, the audio read-in and real time files were run when a user was actively using the ECG and able to detect stress levels in 5-minute intervals.

Graviteam Applied Physiology Lab - 
The Graviteam were the peers and PhD students in Georgia Tech’s Applied Physiology
Lab that I volunteered research with. My main role aside from assisting in data collection was to map out the important segments of data during each subject’s jump as the goal was to test adaptability. The data was input from a text file with force sensor values of an individual’s jump from start to end, and through the use of sliding windows, I condensed and normalized thousands of values into coherent depictions of the jump process at different adaptation levels.

Arduino/Bird Project - 
This is the second segment to a personal project tackled by one of my friend’s and I.
After being able to rebuild an electric scooter, we were also able to figure out how to recode a proprietary electronic speed controller made by BIRD. Using their signals, we were able to recode and fix broken scooters using a basic ARM chip.
Hydrophobicity/Oleophilicity Research
This folder contains the research I worked on and presented about different material properties. The main one tested under the supervision of a PhD student was on the effects of carbon nanofibers, and their special material properties that allowed water to be suspended on micro and nanostructures yet allow oils to fully absorb.

Fusion Files - 
I’ve begun learning Fusion360 (CAD) this year and have made quite a bit of progress.
This folder includes a PDF with some of my more relevant works and links to access the files as well as official explosion view documentation I created. Some of the more important projects I’ve worked on are the different eye dropper designs which are currently being used for a semester project I’m currently researching and working on.

Flow Med-Tech - 
CFD documentation compilation of summer internship work. Worked specifically with running simulations on FeBio and testing its effectiveness for FMT device design functions.
